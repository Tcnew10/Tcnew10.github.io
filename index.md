# Tyler Newton â€“ CAD Portfolio  

Welcome to my mechanical engineering CAD portfolio.  
Here youâ€™ll find a selection of my **SolidWorks projects**, including parametric models, assemblies, renderings, and motion studies.  

This portfolio highlights:  
- 3D modeling and parametric design  
- Assembly management and exploded views  
- Motion studies and kinematic simulations  
- Engineering drawings and GD&T  
- Design for manufacturing (sheet metal, injection molding, 3D printing)
